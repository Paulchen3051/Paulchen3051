Hello
I have been using Weewx for a few years to integrate the data from a weather station into my homepage. 
The weather station no longer works properly and I still have a Bresser7in1 station that I can integrate via SDR.
However, this does not transmit air pressure, so I would like to achieve this with a BME280. 
Unfortunately, none of the instructions on the internet work. 
I've been trying this for weeks now. 
I use a Rasapberry 3+ with Bullsey operating system and Weewx version 4.9.0. 
I have already tried several Weewx and had no success integrating the BME280. 
Only errors are displayed because the instructions are in most cases very old. 
There are small, simple programs that read the data from the BME280, but I don't know how to integrate them into Weewx.
e.g. "pip install BME280" which displays the values with read_bme280. Do you perhaps have a solution?
Best regards
W. Spitzner
